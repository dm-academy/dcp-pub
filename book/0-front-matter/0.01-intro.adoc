== Introduction

anchor:0.01-emergence[]

Welcome to Agile IT Management: From Startup to Enterprise.

This is a "survey" text intended for the advanced undergraduate or graduate student interested in the general field of applied IT management. It is grounded in basic computing fundamentals, but does not require any particular technical skills to understand. You do not need to have taken any courses in networking, security, or particular programming languages to read this book.

However, you will be presented with material on such topics, including fragments of programming languages and pseudocode, and need to be willing to invest the time and effort to understand.

=== A process of emergence

One of the most important and distinguishing features of this book is its "emergence model." In keeping with the entrepreneurial spirit that gave rise to the Agile movement and works like Ries' http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307887898/[_The Lean Startup_,] the book adopts a progressive, evolutionary approach. Your journey through it reflects a process of emergence. Such processes are often associated with founding and scaling a startup. There are many helpful books on this topic, such as:

* http://www.amazon.com/Nail-then-Scale-Entrepreneurs-Breakthrough/dp/0983723605[_Nail it then scale it_] by Furr and Ahlstrom
* http://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Up-Companies-Rockefeller-Habits-ebook/dp/B00O5RR7QO/[_Scaling Up_] by Harnish
* http://www.amazon.com/Startup-CEO-Scaling-Business-Website/dp/1118548361[_Startup CEO_] by Blumberg
* http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_y[_The Lean Startup_] by Ries

However, this is not a textbook (or course) on entrepreneurship. It remains IT-centric. *And, the book is also intended to be relevant to students entering directly into large, established enterprises.* In fact, it prepares you for working in all stages of growth because it progresses through these four contexts:

* Individual (founder)
* Team
* Small company (team of teams)
* Enterprise

Whether you are in a startup, or on a journey within a larger, established organization, you will (hopefully) become aware as you progress through a broadening context:

* Other team members
* Customers
* Suppliers
* Sponsors
* Necessary non-IT capabilities (finance, legal, HR, sales, marketing, etc)
* Channel partners
* Senior executives and funders
* Auditors and regulators

Part of maturing in one's career is understanding how all these relationships figure into your own overall system of value delivery. This will be a lifelong journey for the student; the author's intent is to provide some useful tools.

=== This book's structure

Here is a conceptual illustration of an IT management progression:

Elaborating the above outline into chapters, we have:

..... *Founder*

. _IT value_. Why do we need computers? What can they do for us?
. _IT infrastructure_ We want to build something. We have to choose a platform first.
. _IT applications_ Let's start building something of use to someone.

..... *Team*
[start=4]
. _Product management_ What exactly is it we are building? How do we better define it for a bigger team?
. _Work management_ How do we keep track and communicate at the most basic level?
. _Operations management_ How do we sustain this surprisingly fragile computing-based service, in its ongoing delivery of IT value?

..... *Team of Teams*
[start=7]
. _Culture and organization_ We're getting big. How do we deal with this? How are we structured? Why this way and not that? What are the unwritten values and rules in our company?
. _Project and resource management_ Work is becoming larger and more complex. We need the ability to track and execute larger segments of it, and coordinate across the teams.
. _Process management_ We have a structure. Work needs to flow across it. Product and project teams increasingly demand predictable, consistent delivery of internal services, and synchronization points such as enterprise releases are increasingly critical signals.

..... *Enterprise*
[start=10]
. _Security, and governance, risk, and compliance_ We need to cope with external forces (regulators, vendor partners, security adversaries, auditors) increasingly defining our options.

. _Enterprise information management_ We've been concerned with data, information, and knowledge since the earliest days of our journey. But at this scale, we have to formalize our approaches and understandings; without that, we will never capture the full value available with modern analytics and Big Data. Compliance issues are also compelling us to formalize here.

. _Architecture and portfolio_ We need to understand the big picture of interacting lifecycles, reduce technical debt and redundancy, accelerate development through establishing platforms, and obtain better economies of scale. We need to define our investment strategy based on a sound understanding of both business needs and technology limitations.

..... *Appendices*
. _A review of IT frameworks and standards_
. _Architectural depictions_
. _Towards a theory of IT management_

The intent is that the more complex, "enterprise"-scale concerns at the end of the book are presented as part of a logical progression.

=== Emergence means formalization
The emergence model seeks to define a likely order in which concerns are *formalized*. Any concern may of course arise at any time: the startup founder certainly is concerned with security!

Formalization means at least one or more of the following:

* Dedicated resources
* Dedicated organization
* Defined policies and processes
* Automated tooling

In the author's experience, startups avoid formalized process and project management. To the extent the concerns exist, they are _tacit_ (understood or implied; suggested; implicit). Certainly, a small startup does not invest in an enterprise-class service desk tool supporting a full array of IT management processes, or a full-blown Project Management Office with associated portfolio automation. Simple work management, with a manual or automated Kanban board, is likely their choice for work management.

But by the time they are a team of teams, specialization has emerged and more robust processes and tools are required. The danger of course is that the formalization effort may be driven by its own logic, and start to lose track of the all-critical business context.

By careful examining these stages of maturation, and the industry responses to them, it is the author's hope that the student will have effective tools to critically engage with the problem of scaling the digital organization.

_Instructor's note_

I have spent considerable time thinking (agonizing) about the correct ordering of the chapters within these sections. This is possibly the tenth or twelfth version of the chapter ordering. This is an area where I want critical review, but also have strong opinions.

There is benefit to restricting the chapters to 12, as a typical semester runs 14 weeks and the book then fits quite nicely, with one chapter per class and allowing for an introductory session and final exam. (Trying to modfiy the semester system is out of scope for this project.) Of course, a two-semester series, with 2 weeks per chapter, would also work well; each half of the book is also a logical unit.

The governing thought experiment is, "what would I turn my attention to next as my IT-based concerns scale up?" For example, I think work management (implying rudimentary workflow) correctly comes before formalized project management, and project management comes before fully formalized process management (including frameworks such as CMMI, COBIT and ITIL).

Note that this would be a testable and falsifiable theory, if empirical research were done to inventory and characterize organization scaling patterns. If we found (for example) that a majority of organizations formalize governance, risk, security and compliance practices before formalizing project management, that would indicate that those chapters should be re-ordered.

(In my experience, small/medium businesses may have some formal IT project management capability but security & GRC are still tacit, not formalized. This does not mean security is not a concern, but they have not yet hired a CISO, nor instituted formal controls).

Also, you may notice that *the chapter titles don't necessarily reflect "Agile" terminology*. This is also deliberate, as students are going into a diverse world of much long-established IT. Furthermore, putting "Agile" as a qualifier on each chapter seems gratuitous (e.g. "Agile Operations Management" instead of just "Operations Management.")

The first word of the book's title is "Agile." That declares the orientation, and the proof will be in the reading. My intent is to involve experienced Agile practitioners in contributing to the sections most relevant to them, and I anticipate a high quality end result that is recognizably supportive of the Agile movement's goals and ambitions.

The book however is not a complete dismissal of older models of IT delivery. Wherever possible, Agile is presented as an evolutionary step relative to what has gone before. The specifics of "what's different" are identified, in the interest of de-mystifying what can be a fraught and quasi-religious topic. In the words of Don Reinertsen, you can have "faith based Agile or science based Agile." This book is strictly interested in the latter. Pointers to relevant theory are included, although this is NOT a theoretical text. That will come later...footnote:[Effective pedagogy requires theory. I seek assistance in both the emerging theory of IT, and relevant theories of pedagogy. I am an amateur in both.]

*This emergence model can also be understood as an individual's progression within a larger enterprise.* Even if one starts from Day 1 at a Fortune 100 corporation, I believe the progression of one's understanding still progresses through individual, to team, to "team of teams," to enterprise. Of course, one may cease evolving one's understanding at any of these stages, with corresponding implications for one's career.

Some of you may be familiar with the idea of a Minimum Viable Product, Minimum Marketable Release, or similar. In these terms, it is important to understand that each *section* of the book represents an MVP, but not each chapter. One can't begin to deliver IT value without the components discussed in each of Chapters 1-3. The chapters of each section are interdependent, in other words.

More structure w/in structure: Each chapter flows in a roughly "top-down" fashion:

. "Business" concerns (value, motivation)
. "Process" concerns (execution, flow)
. "System" concerns (information & automation)
