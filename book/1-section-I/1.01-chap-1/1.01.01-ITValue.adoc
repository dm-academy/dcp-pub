==== What is IT value?

image::images/1.01-woman.jpg[]

Consider the following scenario:

A woman is wondering if she can afford to dine out that evening.

* She uses her mobile device to access her banking information and determines that in fact she does have enough money to do so.

* She also uses her mobile device to make a reservation and contact some friends to join her.

* Finally, she uses social navigation software to avoid heavy traffic, arriving at the restaurant in time for an enjoyable evening with her friends.

Information technology pervaded this experience. The origins, layers and complex connections of the distributed systems involved are awe-inspiring to consider.

IMPORTANT: *Don't worry about the technological terms for now*

This is an introductory text. You may see terms below that are unfamiliar (Model-View-Controller, IP, packet switching). If you are reading this on line, you can follow the links, but it's not required.

As you progress in your career, you will always be encountering new terminology. Part of what you need to learn is when it's important to dig into it, and when you can let it pass for a time.

You should be able to understand the gist presented below, that these are complex systems based on a wide variety of technologies, some of them old, some new.

The screen on her cell phone represents information accessed and presented via a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller[Model-View-Controller framework], implemented in the latest version of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript[Javascript], running on an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)[interpreter] that would have taxed a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer[mainframe] thirty years ago. The communication with her bank’s central systems is supported by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)[4G LTE] data which in turn relies on the high-volume https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol[IP backbone] networks operated by the http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/telecom-carrier[telecommunications carriers], based on research into https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching[packet switching] now approaching 50 years’ old.

The application operating on the cell phone interacts with core banking systems via sophisticated and highly secure https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware[middleware], crossing multiple https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network[network] control points. This middleware talks in turn to the customer demand deposit system which still runs on the mainframe.

The mainframe is now running the latest version of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/OS[IBM’s zOS] operating system (a direct descendant of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360_and_successors#MVT[OS/360], one of the most  significant operating systems in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing[history of computing]). The "customer demand deposit" banking application running on the mainframe is still based on code written in the lowest level https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language[assembler]. Some of the comments in this code date back to the 1970s. It has been tuned and optimized over the decades into a system of remarkable speed and efficiency and, although replatforming it is periodically discussed, the cost/benefit ratio for such a project has to date not been favorable.

The reservation system looks similar on the mobile device, but the network routes it to a large https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing[Cloud] data center hosting the reservation system. The back end application here is very different from the banking system; the programming languages are newer, the database is structured very differently, and the operating system is https://www.linux.com/[Linux].

Finally, the navigation software looks much like the reservation system, as it too is based on the Cloud. However, the system is much more active, as it is continually processing inputs from millions of drivers in thousands of cities, and updating traffic maps for those drivers in real time so that they can choose the most optimal route to their destinations (e.g., dinner). The capabilities of this system are comparable to an air traffic control system, and yet it is available as a free download for our IT user.

The resulting value is clear:

* In an earlier era, our user might have stayed in, for fear of bouncing a check, or might have gone out and dined beyond her means.
* The phone line at the restaurant might have been busy, so she might have risked showing up with no reservation.
* Before texting and social media, she might not have been able to reach her friends as easily.
* Without the traffic application she might have run into a huge midtown traffic jam and been half an hour late.

Clearly, information technology added value to her life and helped maximize her experiences of social enjoyment.

_Discuss: How does information technology contribute to your enjoyment of life and experiences of value?_
