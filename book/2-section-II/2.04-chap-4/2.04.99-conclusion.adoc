==== Conclusion

Product-centric thinking is at the core of delivering digital value. Without a clear understanding of the product and its context, investments of time and resources are at risk.

As with most other chapters in this book, this brief survey cannot do justice to such a broad field.

===== Discussion questions
* Can you identify two or three distinct features for a commercial product such as Facebook or Netflix? Try to "reverse engineer" features that might have been individual areas of investment.
* In your product idea, what specific features - self-contained, cohesive, and independent of each other - can you think of?
* Can you think of any components  (as defined above) you will need?

===== Research & practice
* Review the Scaled Agile Framework's descriptions of http://www.scaledagileframework.com/feature/[features] and http://www.scaledagileframework.com/stories/[user stories]. Document one feature consisting of several stories for your product.
* Research Behavior-Driven Development and consider its potential value for you.
