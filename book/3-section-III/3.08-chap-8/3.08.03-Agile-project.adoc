==== Agile and project management
[quote, Stanley Portny, Project Management for Dummies 4th ed.]
Projects of all types and sizes are now *the* way that organizations accomplish their work [emphasis added].

[quote, Sriram Narayan, "Scaling Agile: Problems and Solutions"]
...the project as a vehicle of IT execution has by and large, failed to live up to its promise of predictable delivery.

[quote, Charles G. Cobb, The Project Manager's Guide to Mastering Agile: Principles and Practices for an Adaptive Approach]
Agile is having a profound impact on the project management profession and will cause us to fundamentally rethink many of the well-established notions of what a project manager is...

As the above quotes indicate, there are diverse opinions on the role and importance of traditional project management in the enterprise. Clearly it is under pressure from the Agile movement. Project management professionals are advised to not deny or diminish this fact. It is possible for a modern, IT-centric organization to make considerable progress on the basis of xref:2.04.00-product-mgmt[product management] plus simple xref:2.05.00-work-management[work management], without the overhead of the formalized project lifecycle suggested by PMBOK.

One of the primary criticisms of project management as a paradigm is that it promotes large "batches" of work.

Cloud is having impacts on traditional project management as well. As noted in the section on the xref:trad-IT-decline[decline of traditional IT], projects were often used to install vendor-delivered commodity software, such as for payroll or employee expense. Increasingly, that kind of functionality is delivered by online service providers, leaving "traditional" internal IT with considerably reduced responsibilities.

Some of the IT capability may remain in the guise of an internal "service broker," to assist with the sourcing and procurement of online services. The remainder moves into digital product management, as the only need for internal IT is in the area of revenue-generating, market-facing strategic digital product.

So, this section will examine the following questions:

* Given the above trends, under what circumstances does formalized project management make economic sense?
* Assuming that formalized project management is employed, how does one continue to support objectives such as fast feedback and adaptability?

===== Scaling one product
[quote, Mike Cohn, Succeeding with Agile]
Good team structure can go a long way toward reducing dependencies but will not eliminate them.

[quote, Mark Kennaley, SDLC 3.0]
Where leveraging yellow stickies or index cards makes sense in conjunction with practices like big visible charts and co-location, such formats become ridiculous for a large constituency of challenging projects . . . When faced with these challenges, rather than proclaim that Agile won't work or doesn't scale, the preferable approach is to understand and acknowledge the nature of collaboration, the nature of distributed workflow, and the complexity of modern product development.

[quote,  Gary Hamel, preface to the Open Organization: Igniting Passion and Performance]
What’s typically underestimated is the complexity and indivisibility of many large-scale coordination tasks.

As we discussed in the xref:3.07.00-Chap-7[Chapter 7], we are introducing multiple feature teams as our product scales up:

image::images/3.08-multi-feature.png[]

The decision process by which the features are identified is still informal (we will not formalize this until Chapter 12.) However, the term "architecture" is likely emerging through these discussions.

As noted in the discussion of xref:loose-coupling-project[loose coupling and project management], some needs for coordination may be mitigated through the design of the product itself. If the features and components have well defined protocols for their interaction and clear contracts for matters like performance, development on each team can move forward with some autonomy.

****
*The reality of microservices and loose coupling: the case of Chubby at Google*

The idea that architecture can "emerge" across a set of smaller grained services ("microservices"), without explicit coordination, is attractive. Coordinating designs across products is expensive and ideally products should be able to evolve independently.

Mike Burrows of Google provides a detailed description of the Chubby lock service <<Burrows2006>>, which is a prototypical example of a broadly-available internal service usable by a wide variety of other products.

The purpose of a lock service is to "allow its clients to synchronize their activities and to agree on basic information about their environment." Chubby was built from the start with objectives of reliability, availability to a "moderately large set of clients," and ease of understanding.

Burrows notes that even with such a cohesive and well-designed internal service, they still encounter coordination problems requiring human intervention. Such problems include:

* Use ("abuse") in unintended ways by clients
* Invalid assumptions by clients regarding Chubby's availability

Because of this, the Chubby team (at least at the time writing of the case study) instituted a review process when new clients wished to start using the lock manager.

In terms of this chapter's topic, this means that someone on the product team needed to coordinate the discussions with the Chubby team and ensure that any concerns were resolved. This might conceivably have involved multiple iterations and reviews of designs describing intended use.

In short, even the most sophisticated microservice environments may require some level of  human coordination across the teams. Project management provides a framework for doing this and encourages the development of appropriate skills.

But at scale, complexity is inevitable. What happens when a given business objective requires coordinated effort across multiple teams?

For example, an online ecommerce site might find itself overwhelmed by business success. Upgrading the site to accommodate the new demand might require distinct development work to be performed by most or all of the teams:

image::images/3.08-multi-feature-coord.png[]

As the quote from Gary Hamel above indicates, a central point of coordination and accountability is advisable, otherwise the objective is at risk. (It becomes "someone else's problem.")

===== Scaling to more than one product
 disclaimer: the "fairness" driver is hypothetical

In keeping with the xref:0.01-emergence[emergence model] thought experiment, another key state transition is from one product to multiple products.

This is substantially distinct from scaling one product through subdividing it into multiple features.

Consider our hypothetical startup company:

image::images/3.08-one-product.png[]

Establishment of a second product team raises issues:

image::images/3.08-multi-product.png[]

When everyone on the team is supporting one product and dedicated to its success, there is less sense of contention with "others" in the organization. This changes dramatically with the addition of a second product. Concerns for fair allocation and a sense of internal competition naturally arise out of this diversification.

Beecause resources are always limited, it is critical that the demands of each product be managed using objective criteria, requiring formalization.  This was a different problem when you were a tight-knit startup; you were constrained, but everyone knew they were "in it together." Now you need some ground rules to support your increasingly diverse activities. This leads to new concerns:

* Managing scope and preventing unintended creep or drift from the product's original charter
* Managing contention for enterprise resources
* Execution to timeframes (e.g. the critical trade show)
* Coordinating dependencies (e.g. achieving larger, cross-product goals)
* Accountability for results

Fairness is deeply wired into the human brain [cites], and the creation of a new product (and associated team) provokes new dynamics in the growing company.

Project management provides tools addressing these issues, which is why it is widely used.

However, there are a number of issues in doing so.

* Projects are by definition temporary, while products may last as long as there is market demand.
* Project management methodology, with its emphasis on predictability, scope management, and change control often conflicts with the product management objective of discovering information (see the discussion of xref:2.04.04-lean-product-dev[Lean Product Development].)
** But not all product management activities involve the creation of new information!

Scope, execution, limited resources, and dependencies exist throughout digital business. A product manager with no understanding of these issues, or tools to deal with them, will likely fail.

Product managers should therefore be familiar with the basic concepts of project management. The project paradigm has a benefit in its explicit limitation of time and money, and the sense of urgency this creates. However, the way in which project management is implemented, the degree of formality, will vary according to need.

So, what of project management in this new world? A project manager may still be required, to facilitate discussions, record decisions, and keep the team on track to its stated direction and commitments. Regardless of whether the team considers itself "Agile," people are sometimes bad at taking notes or being consistent in their usage of tools such as Kanban boards and standups.

It is also useful to have a third party who is knowledgeable about the product, yet has some emotional distance from its success. This can be a difficult balance to strike, but the existence of the role of Scrum coach is indicative of its importance.

===== Governing outsourced work
A third major reason for the continued use of project management and its techniques is governing work that has been outsourced to third parties. This is covered in detail in the section on xref:sourcing[sourcing].

===== Organizational tools and techniques
Our previous discussion of xref:2.05.00-work-management[work management]was a simple, idealized flow of uniform demand (new product functionality, issues, etc). Tasks in general did not have dependencies, or dependencies were handled through ad-hoc coordination. We also in general assumed that resources (people) were available to perform the tasks; resource contention, while it certainly may have come up, was again handled through ad-hoc means.

As we progress on our journey and continue to scale up, we see that dependencies and resource management have become defining concerns, and the concept of "project management" is a primary response. However, we retain our concern for fast feedback and adaptability, as well as a critical approach to the idea that complex initiatives can be precisely defined and simply executed through xref:2.00.1-open-loop[open loop] approaches.

Above, we've discussed a few aspects of the coordination problem including the emergent issues when needed capabilities span feature teams, and when new product lines are introduced. In this section, we will discuss some of the organizational responses (techniques and tools) that have emerged as proven responses to these emergent issues.

The general problem is, "how do I facilitate the adaptive generation of information under conditions of time and space shifting." That is to say:

* digital product development (as all R&D) is essentially xref:2.04.04-lean-product-dev[information generation]
* as it scales up, we encounter emergent coordination needs
* that present rapidly increasing combinatoric complexity
* that may be exacerbated by time and space shifting

We have seen earlier versions of this problem in our discussions of work management. However, simple Kanban and visual Andon is no longer sufficient, given the nature of the coordination we now require. We need a more diverse and comprehensive set of techniques.

IMPORTANT: The discussion of particular techniques is always hazardous. People will tend to latch on to a promising approach without fully discussing the "target operating condition." Review the discussion of xref:Toyota-Kata[Toyota Kata]. As noted by <<Larman2009>> (p.44), the risk is one of xref:cargo-cult[cargo cult] process adoption.

The primary objective remains one of "coordination" (as suggested by the overall name of this section, xref:Section-III-coordination[Coordination].)

Here are a few techniques suggested by various Agile authors (primarily <<Cohn2010>>)

====== Co-location

Don Reinertsen (<<Reinertsen2009>>, p. 230), proposes "The Principle of Colocation" which asserts that "Colocation improves almost all aspects of communication." In order to scale this, one logically needs what Mike Cohn (<<Cohn2010>>, p. 346) calls "The Big Room."

In terms of communications, this has significant organizational advantages. Communications are as simple as walking over to another person's desk, or just shouting out over the room. It is also easy to synchronize the entire room, through calling for everyone's attention.

However, there are limits to scaling the "Big Room" approach:

* Contention for key individual's attention
* "All hands" calls for attention that actually interest only a subset of the room
* Increasing ambient noise in the room
* Distracting individuals from intellectually demanding work requiring concentration, and ultimately interfering with their xref:personal-flow[personal
 sense of flow] - a destructive outcome.

The tension between team coordination and individual focus will likely continue. It is an ongoing topic in facilities design.

 [recent popular press about problems of open space working, and responsive facilities with various workspace types available on reservation]

====== Synchronization points
If the team cannot work all the time in one room, then perhaps they can at least be gathered periodically. There is a broad spectrum of synchronization approaches:

* Daily standups
* Weekly status meetings
* Coordination meetings (e.g. Scrum of Scrums, see below)
* Release kickoffs
* Quarterly "all-hands" meetings
* Open Space inspired "unmeetings" and "unconferences"

All of them are essentially similar in approach and assumption: build a shared understanding of the work, objectives, or mission among smaller or larger sections of the organization, through limited-time face to face interaction, often on a defined time interval.

 Meetings bloody meetings

 Sidebar: Practical collaboration at scale (Chapter 7??)
 Unmeetings/unconferences/Open space

====== Liaison and coordination structures
[quote, Atul Gawande, The Checklist Manifesto]
The philosophy is that you push the power of decision making out to the periphery and away from the center. You give people the room to adopt, based on their experiences and expertise. All you ask is that they talk to one another and take responsibility. That is what works.

A variety of liaison and coordination approaches are suggested by Mike Cohn (<<Cohn2010>>, Chapter 17, "Scaling Scrum") including:

* Shared team members
* Integration teams
* Communities of practice
* Scrum of scrums

 Refactor this. Include submittal schedules in list. Find out Cohn's original sources. Other techniques?

*Shared team members* are suggested when two teams have a persistent interface requiring focus and ownership. When a product has multiple interfaces that emerge as a problem requiring focus, an *integration team* may be called for. *Communities of practice* were introduced in Chapter 7 as we discussed the xref:spotify-model[Spotify model]. Considered here, they may also play a coordination role as well as a practice development/maturity role.

Finally, the idea of a "scrum of scrums" is essentially a representative or delegated model, in which each individual Scrum team sends one individual to a periodic coordination meeting where matters of cross-team concern can be discussed and decisions taken.

<<Cohn2010>> (p342) cautions: "A scrum of scrums meeting will feel nothing like a daily scrum despite the similarities in names. The daily scrum is a synchronization meeting: individual team members come together to communicate about their work and synchronize their efforts.The scrum of scrums, on the other hand, is a problem-solving meeting and
will not have the same quick, get-in-get-out tone of a daily scrum."

anchor:submittal-schedule[]
Another perspective on this is found in The Checklist Manifesto <<Gawande2010>>. Some work, while detailed, can be planned to a high degree of detail (i.e. the "checklists" of the title). However, emergent complexity requires different approach - no checklist can anticipate all eventualities. To handle all the emergent complexity, the coordination focus must shift to structuring the right communications. In examining modern construction industry techniques, Gawande noted the concept of the "submittal schedule," which "didn't specify construction tasks; it specified _communication_ tasks" (p. 65, emphasis supplied).

====== Planning techniques
Techniques of co-location, synchronization, and liaison all support to varying degrees a concept of planning. Fundamentally, we plan so that the work progresses effectively and efficiently. We seek to optimize the following contradictory goals:

* Delivering results quickly
* Minimizing the waste of un-utilized resources

To meet these goals, we

* estimate so that we have some understanding of our resource needs
* plan so that we understand dependencies (e.g. when one team *must* complete a task before another team can start theirs)

The above discussion is by no means exhaustive. A wealth of additional techniques is to be found in <<Larman2009>> and <<Cohn2010>>. New techniques are continually emerging from the front lines of the digital industry; the interested student should consider attending industry conferences such as those offered by the Agile Alliance.

===== The end of the "iron triangle?"
 cite Edwards & others - focus on throughput moves the needle on other metrics - but not the reverse.

===== The future of project management

Recall our three "Ps":

* Product
* Project
* Process

Taken together, the three represent a coherent set of concerns for value delivery in various forms. But in isolation, any one of them ultimately is limited. This is a particular challenge for project management, whose practitioners may identify deeply with their chosen field of expertise.

Clearly, formalized project management is under pressure. Its methods are perceived by the Agile community as overly heavyweight; its practitioners are criticized for focusing too much on success in terms of cost and schedule performance and not enough on business outcomes. Because projects are by definition temporary, project managers have little incentive to care about technical debt or operational consequences. Hence the rise of the product manager.

However, a product manager who does not understand the fundamentals of project execution will not succeed. As we have seen, modern products, especially in organizations scaling up, have dependencies and coordination needs, and to meet those needs, project management tools will continue to provide value.
