===== The Agile project frameworks

As of this writing, a number of frameworks have been developed at the intersection of Agile and project management. Notable examples include:

* The Scaled Agile Framework (http://www.scaledagileframework.com/)
* Disciplined Agile Delivery (http://www.disciplinedagiledelivery.com/)

Other Agile authors are skeptical of the need for such material <<Schwaber2013>>.

===== The two dimensions of demand management
Project management is our first major specialization of xref:2.05.00-work-management[Chapter 5]'s general concept of "work management." (We will turn to process management in the next chapter.) In the interest of keeping project management firmly in context, consider the following two-dimensional analysis:

image::images/3.08-2d-demand.png[]

You should spend some time considering the graphic, which provides a unique way of understanding the work you are now experiencing as a "team of teams" or "manager of managers" in an IT-dependent environment of increasing size and complexity.

We've come a long ways from the last section's insistence that "it's all just work." But there still is an essential truth there. Regardless of the abstract label we put on a given activity, it represents some set of tasks or objectives that real people are going to take time to perform, and expect to be compensated for. Retaining a clear realization of this is essential to maintaining truly business-aligned IT management.

Let's consider the various forms that demand may take. While this may not be project management per se, it's essential to putting project management in a broader context. This will also help you develop a deeper understanding of an *architecture of IT management*, a topic the author has explored in other works <<Betz2011>>.

The diagram has two dimensions:

* Planning
* Granularity

The bubbles represent a "space" where one is likely to find that kind of work. As indicated by the central diagonal, it reflects an assumption that larger amounts of work are more likely to be planned further in advance. However, this is not always true. A large, unwelcome amount of required work that shows up with no planning is probably a disaster. Desired work (in the form of aggregate transactional demand) may also spike unexpectedly.

 [The following table is work in process, currently with just a few examples filled in]

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Type of work |Description
|Core transactional demand
|This is the demand on the fully automated IT system for a given moment of truth: a banking account lookup, a streaming movie, a Human Resources record update
|Routine service requests and incidents
|Service requests are predefined, process-driven work items, rarely requiring creative thought or analysis. Incidents span a spectrum, but some are simpler and more routine than others, especially those stemming from user misunderstanding or error.
|Changes
|Changes represent modifications of established IT functionality or xref:2.06.03-state[state]. They represent some definite risk to one or more IT services, which is why they are planned on a longer lead time. However, they ideally remain relatively granular, which helps reduce their risk.
|Routine releases, stories, reports
|Releases and (in the Agile world) stories represent larger increments of functionality
|Services and Projects
|A Project is a large, planned amount of work with a defined end date. It might create a Service, which also represents a commitment to a large, ongoing amount of work, perhaps comparable in scope to the Project.
|Severe incidents
|Severe incidents by definition are not planned. But they represent a significant amount of work to overcome.
|===

Some forms of work may lead to other forms of work. For example, Projects may manifest as Stories, Releases, and Changes. This complicates the diagram a bit; we don't want to "double-count" work effort. But not all Releases derive from Projects, and not all Project work (especially in complex environments) can be cleanly reduced to a set of smaller tasks.

The final point of this diagram: you only have so much capacity to execute the work it implies. If you have a disaster, it may impact your ability to deliver user stories, changes, or even meet transactional demand. Trade-offs must be considered.

===== Earned value management

EVM could be described as a "model" used for understanding the
execution of software projects. It includes mathematical formulae
which are intended to provide insights into project dynamics. However
as will be discussed, the model does not take into consideration
feedback. It is an Open-Loop system model. Kennaley p44

or translating EVM directly to the balance sheet (EVM always being a fiction and less and less useful in a digitally transforming world)

====== The systems problem

[quote, Mark Kennaley, SDLC 3.0]
When risk and uncertainty are present with ongoing demand, like in the case of architectural changes and related high-stake decisions, batching demand into a project for governance reasons makes sense...

Kennaley, above, provides some reasoning for project management. Ironically, he uses the term "batch," which is often a concept unfavorably viewed in Agile and Lean circles.

Not all problems respond to iteration. Sometimes, deeper analysis is necessary. When a system presents multiple constraints that need to be solved simultaneously, the only way to do this with confidence may be as a "batch" of thought and analysis. If one needs to balance several competing objectives, one may need to know how a given course of action will affect all of them before embarking. Solving for one constraint (even iteratively), and embarking on a plan of action, may result in not meeting the other constraints, and having to throw the whole solution away.

Dogmatic approaches to solving this are unhelpful.  Multi-constraint optimization is a known hard problem in systems engineering and cannot be wished away through merely invoking the word "Agile."

===== Project management antipatterns
* Impersonal requirements (but see Alleman)
* "nothing is real unless it's a project"
* "Water-scrum-fall"

When taken to an extreme, the PMO becomes the arbiter of ALL IT investments in some organizations. Support and operational activities are chartered as long-running "projects" and staff time is billed through them (more on this in the section on Resource Management.) Essentially, this is how a product management approach emerges from taking the project management paradigm to an ultimate conclusion.


===== Scrum of scrums and its critiques
identical to a chapter-based grassroots organization
trouble is that emergent problems at each level start to distract & take over
by the time you are to level 3, how do you maintain "credibility" at the base
trade unions...

the quest for "authenticity" and the suspicion of systems thinkers

The concept of "scrum of scrums" may make intuitive sense, but starts to run into issues of power, hierarchy, authority, accountability, and so forth. It is mostly presented as a bottom-up structure, and there is an implication that the representatives are also practitioners. (There is a strong narrative of authenticity in the Agile community. The lack of respect for "non-coders" is pronounced.) But what happens when overriding systems concerns need to be communicated downwards in the face of team resistance? What of the "scrum of scrums" representative who is perceived (rightly or wrongly) as not advocating reliably for the team? What of the team who rotates their delegate out of well-intentioned motives related to individual empowerment, but resulting in ineffective representation?

In these questions we see the overlap of Agile with seemingly distant fields such as political science, organizational leadership, and the like.

===== Notes

Project v program: Program: This term can describe two different situations. First, a program can be a set of goals that gives rise to specific projects, but, unlike a project, a program can never be completely accomplished. For example, a health-awareness program can never completely achieve its goal (the public will never be totally aware of all health issues as a result of a health-awareness program), but one or more projects may accomplish specific results related to the program’s goal (such as a workshop on minimizing the risk of heart disease). Second, a program sometimes refers to a group of specified projects that achieve a common goal.
