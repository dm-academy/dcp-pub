==== Why process management?
[quote, Michael Porter, Competitive Advantage]
Is a firm a collection of activities or a set of resources and capabilities? Clearly, a firm is both. But activities are what firms do, and they define the resources and capabilities that are relevant.


We have previously discussed product and project management. You may wish to review our summary description of xref:2.04.01-process-project-product[process, product, and project management].

Process management starts with the fundamental capability for coordinated xref:2.05.00-work-management[work management], and refines it much further.

In our company, work has been specializing. A simple card-based kanban approach is no longer sufficient. We are finding that some work is repetitive, and we need to remember to do certain things in certain orders.

For example, a new Human Resources (HR) manager was hired. The HR manager decided that a sticky note of "hire someone new for us" was not sufficient. As she pointed out to the team, hiring needed to follow a defined sequence of tasks:

* Establishing the need and purpose for the position
* Soliciting candidates
* Filtering the candidates
* Selecting a final choice
* Registering that new employee in the payroll system
* Getting the new employee set up with benefits providers (insurance, retirement, etc)
* Getting the new employee working space, equipment, and access to systems
* Training the new employee in organizational policies as well as any position-specific orientation

The sales, marketing, and finance teams have similarly been developing ordered lists of tasks that are consistently executed as end to end sequences. And even in the core digital development and operations teams, they are finding that some tasks are repetitive and need documentation so they are performed consistently.

More broadly, your entire digital product pipeline is sometimes called a "process." From initial feature idea through production, you seek a consistent means for identifying and implementing valuable functionality. Sometimes this work requires intensive, iterative collaboration and is unpredictable (e.g. developing a user interface); sometimes, the work is more repeatable (e.g. packaging and releasing tested functionality).

However, some team members are cautious of the word "process". The term "process police" comes up in an unhappy way.

"Are we going to have auditors tracking whether we filled out all our forms correctly?," one asks.

"We used to get these consultants in at my old company and they would leave piles of 3 ring binders on the shelf that no-one ever looked at," another person says.

"I can't write code according to someone's recipe!," a third says with some passion, and to general agreement from the developers in the room.

The irony is that digital products are based on process automation. The idea that certain tasks can be done repeatably and at scale through digitization is fundamental to all use of computers. The digital service *is* fundamentally an automated process, one that can be intricate and complicated. That's what computers do. But process management also spans human activities, and that's where things get more complex.

===== From work to process management

So, the kanban board has started to elaborate. We're seeing more and more work that needs to follow a sequence, or checklist... Wait, didn't we see that in the chapter on Project Management?

We discussed task ordering in Chapter 8. However, projects are not usually seen as repeatable.

It all starts with just "work." The following diagram might help:

Project management adds concerns of task ordering and resource management, for projects typically executed on a one-time basis.

Process management is also concerned with ordering, but less so with the resource load (more on this below), and instead is concerned with repeatability and ongoing improvement.

Process management is when we need to start managing

* multiple,
* repeatable,
* measurable sequences of activity,
* considering their interdependencies,
* perhaps using common methods to define them,
* and even common tooling to support multiple processes.

Project management and process management interact in 2 primary ways:

* Projects often are used to create and deploy processes. A large system implementation (e.g. of a Enterprise Resource Planning module such as Human Resource Management) will often be responsible for process implementation including training.
* As environments mature, product and/or project teams require process support.

As Richardson notes in _Project Management Theory and Practice_, "there are many organizational processes that are needed to optimally support a successful project." <<Richardson2010>> For example, the project may require predictable contractor hiring, or infrastructure provisioning, or security reviews. The same is true for product teams that may not be using a "project" concept to manage their work. To the extent these are managed as repeatable, optimized processes, risk is reduced.

===== Process and organization
Processes are much more than repeatable activities. Many leading thinkers (such as Michael Porter, quoted at the start of this chapter section) see organizations primarily as sets of interacting processes, supporting fundamental end to end value chains or value streams. We will talk more about this in the next chapter section.

The concept of process is often contrasted with that of function or organization. We have seen in previous chapters how product development and project management must drive results across organizational boundaries. Process management has a similar challenge; its goal is to drive *repeatable* results across organizational boundaries.

As we know from our discussion of xref:2.04.00-product-mgmt[Product Management], developing new products is not a particularly repeatable process. The Agile movement in some ways arose in opposition to attempts to apply process concepts of "repeatability" to developing software. These concerns remain.

However, this book is not only about digital R&D processes. It is also about a spectrum of operations and effort that spans from the unique to the highly repeatable. There is an interesting middle ground, of processes that are at least semi-repeatable. Examples often found in the large digital organization include:

* Assessing, approving, and completing changes
* End user equipment provisioning
* Resolving incidents and answering user inquiries
* Troubleshooting problems

And many others. We will talk about a wide variety of such processes in the chapter section on process frameworks.

It is important to realize, however, that just as the traditional IT project is under pressure, there are similar challenges for the traditional IT process. Continuous deployment techniques are eroding the need for formal change management. Consumerization is challenging traditional internal IT provisioning practices. And self-service help desks are eliminating some traditional support activities.

Nevertheless, any rumors of an "end to process" are probably greatly exaggerated. There will likely always be complex combinations of automated, semi-automated, and manual activity in digital organizations. Some of this activity will be repeatable enough that the "process" construct will be applied to it. Measurability remains a concern; the Lean philosophy underpinning much Agile thought emphasizes this.

It is therefore useful to understand more fundamentally what processes are, how they operate, and how they are managed and improved.

====== Process as skill
As we discussed at the beginning of this chapter, sometimes new employees come in expecting that you are following certain processes. This is in part because "process" experience can be an important part of an employee's career background. A skilled HR manager may consider their experience with large-scale enterprise hiring processes to be a major part of their qualifications for a position in your company.

This applies to both "business" and "IT" processes. In fact, in the digital world, there is no real difference. Digital processes:

* Initiate new systems, from idea to construction
* Publicize and grant access to the new systems
* Capture revenue from the systems
* Support people in their interactions with the systems
* Fix the systems when they break
* Improve the systems based on stakeholder feedback

It's not clear which of these are "IT" versus "business" processes. But they are definitely processes. Some of them are more predictable, some less so, but they all represent some form of ordered work that is repeatable to some degree. And to some extent, you are seeking people with experience defined at least in part by their exposure to processes.

===== Measuring process
One of the most important reasons for repeatable processes is so that they can be measured and understood. Repeatable processes are measured in terms of:

* Speed
* Effort
* Quality
* Outcomes

at the most general level, and of course all of those measurements must be defined much more specifically depending on the process.

Measurement is an essential aspect of process management, but must be carefully designed. Process participants will behave according to how the process is measured. If a help desk operator is measured and rated on how many calls they process an hour, the quality of those interactions may suffer. It is critical that any process "key performance indicator" be understood in terms of the highest possible business objectives. Is the objective truly to process as many calls as possible? Or is it to satisfy the customer so they need not turn to other channels to get their answers? (More on measurement in the chapter section on xref:continuous-improvement[Continuous Improvement].)
