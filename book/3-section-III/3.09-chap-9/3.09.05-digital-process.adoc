[quote, Manifesto for Agile Software Development]
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

Like project management, the practice of process management is under scrutiny in the new Lean and Agile-influenced digital world.

There's little question the idea of statistical process control for product development has been superseded by Scrum and Lean Product Development. However, this is not only a textbook on product development. It covers all of traditional IT management, in its new guise of the digitally transformed organization. Agile, per se, is primarily about product (software) development, but one thing the frameworks make clear is that development is only part of digital management.

Clearly, the concept of "process" is important and will persist through digital transformation. It seems we need a more robust set of tools to discuss it. Process control theory may offer some. At a more pragmatic level, this chapter will break the problem into a lifecycle of:

* Process conception
* Process content
* Process execution
* Process improvement

Although we don't preface these topics with "Agile" or "Lean," bringing those and related perspectives is the intent of this chapter.

===== Process conception
[quote, Mike Cohn, Succeeding with Agile: Software Development Using Scrum]
"Many companies have at least one dysfunctional area. This may be the “furniture police” who won’t let programmers rearrange furniture to facilitate pair programming. Or it may be a purchasing group that takes six weeks to process a standard software order. In any event these types of insanity get in the way of successful projects."

Processes can generate various emotional reactions:

"Dysfunctional! Insanity!" (as above)

"Follow the process!"

"What bureaucracy!"

"Don't create a 'Process Police'!"

"I am an ITIL professional. I believe in ITIL!"

"I don't write code on an assembly line!"

Such reactions are commonplace in social media, but we need a more objective and rational approach to understand the pros and cons of processes. Don Reinertsen uses a number of neutral concepts towards this end (<<Reinertsen2009>>, chapters 3, 6 and 7):

* Queues
* Work in Process
* Cadence
* Synchronization
* Sequencing

Many of the issues with process comes from a failure to correctly understand and analyze the organization needs in objective terms such as these. This is the focus of xref:toyota-kata[Toyota Kata]. A process is a technique, a tool, and no technique should be implemented without a thorough understanding of the business context. Nor should any technique be implemented without rigorous, disciplined follow-up as to its real effects, both direct and indirect.

A skeptical and self-critical, "go and see" approach is therefore essential. Too often, processes are instituted in reaction to the last data point, imposed top down, and rarely evaluated for effectiveness. Allowing affected parties to lead a process re-design is a core Lean principle (kaizen).

On the other hand, uncoordinated local control of processes can also have destructive effects, as the next section discusses:

====== The pitfall of process "silos"
[quote, Alex Sharp, Workflow Modeling]
One organization enthusiastically embraced process improvement, with good reason: customers, suppliers, and employees found the company's processes slow, inconsistent, and error prone. Unfortunately, they were so enthusiastic that each team defined the work of their small group or department as a complete process. Of course, each of these was in fact the contribution of a specialized functional group to some larger, but unidentified, processes. Each of these "processes" was "improved" independently, and you can guess what happened. +
 +
Within the boundaries of each process, improvements were implemented that made work more efficient from the perspective of the performer. However, these mini-processes were efficient largely because they had front-end constraints that made work easier for the performer but imposed a burden on the customer or the preceding process. The attendant delay and effort meant that the true business processes behaved even more poorly than they had before. This is a common outcome when processes are defined too "small." Moral: Don't confuse subprocesses or activities with business processes.

The above quote well illustrates the dangers of combining local optimization and  process management. Many current authors speak highly of self-organizing teams, but self-organizing teams may seek to optimize locally. Process management was originally intended to overcome this problem, but modeling techniques can be applied at various levels, including within specific departments. This is where enterprise business architecture can assist, to identify these longer, end to end flows of value and highlight the handoff areas, so that the process benefits the larger objective.

====== Process proliferation
Another pitfall we cover here is that of process proliferation.

Process is a powerful tool. Ultimately it is how value is delivered. However, too many processes can have negative results on an organization.

Review the fundamentals of process modeling, and the discussion of the frameworks above. One thing that you do not see is any attention to the resource impacts of the process. This is a primary difference between project and process management; in process management (both theory and frameworks), resource availability is in general assumed.

More advanced forms of process modeling and simulation (see " https://www.google.com/search?q=discrete+event+simulation[discrete event simulation])" can provide insight into the resource demands for processes. However, such techniques 1) require specialized tooling and 2) are not part of the typical BPM practitioner's skillset.

Many enterprise environments have multiple cross-functional processes:

* service requests,
* compliance certifications,
* asset validations,
* provisioning requests,
* capacity assessments,
* change approvals,
* training obligations,
* performance assessments,
* audit responses,
* expense reporting,
* travel approvals,

and many more.

Such processes can be implemented on the assumption that enterprises can always accommodate another process. The result can be dramatic overburden for digital staff in complex environments.

It is therefore advisable to at least keep an inventory of processes that may impose demand on staff, and understand both the aggregate demand as well as the degree of xref:multi-tasking[multi-tasking and context-switching] that may result (as discussed in Chapter 5). Thorough automation of all processes to the maximum extent possible can also drive value, as both load and distraction are reduced.

===== Process content

Sometimes, the process simply becomes too complex for humans to follow. Multi-page process models are rarely consulted, even if the team affected developed them. This is especially true when there are many optional or conditional steps in the process.

There are two related lines of response to this:

* Case Management
* The Checklist Manifesto

====== Case Management

NOTE: Do not confuse "Case" here with Computer Assisted Software Engineering.

Case management is a concept used in medicine, law, and social services. Case management can be thought of as a high-level process supporting the skilled knowledge worker applying their professional expertise.

To quote the Workflow Management Coalition:
****
[Business Process Modeling] and [Case Management] are useful for different kinds of business situations.

* Highly predictable and highly repeatable business situations are best supported with BPM.
** For example signing up for cell phone service: it happens thousands of times a day, and the process is essentially fixed.
* Unpredictable and unrepeatable business situations are best handled with ACM.
** For example investigation of a crime will require following up on various clues, down various paths, which are not predictable before hand. The are various tests and procedures to use, but they will be called only when needed.
<<WFMC2010>>, via <<England2013>>

Noted IT consultant and author Rob England contrasts "case management" with "standard process" in his book  _Plus! The Standard+Case Approach: See Service Response in a New Light_. Some processes are repeatable and can be precisely standardized, but it is critical for anyone working in complex environments to understand the limits of this.

====== The Checklist Manifesto
The Checklist Manifesto is the name of a notable book by author/surgeon Atul Gawande <<Gawande2010>>. The title can be misleading; the book in no way suggests that all work can be reduced to repeatable checklists. Instead, it is another in depth examination of the  relationship between standardization and complexity. Like case management, it addresses the problem of complex activities requiring professional judgement.

Unlike case management, it explores more time-limited and often urgent activities such as flight operations, large scale construction, and surgery. These activities, as a whole, cannot be reduced to one master process; there is too much variation and complexity.

However, within the overall bounds of flight operations, or construction, or surgery, there are critical sequences of events that MUST be executed, often in a specific order. Gawande discusses the airline industry as a key exemplar of this. Instead of one "master checklist" there are specific, clear, brief checklists for a wide variety of scenarios, such as a cargo hold door becoming unlatched.

There are similarities and differences between core BPM approaches and checklists. Often, business process management is employed to describe processes that are automated and whose progress is tracked in a database. Checklists, on the other hand, may be more manual, intended for use in a closely collaborative environment (such as a an aircraft cockpit or operating room), and may represent a briefer period of time.

Finally, in chapter 8, we discussed the concept of the xref:submittal-schedule[submittal schedule], which Gawande encountered in his discussions with the construction industry. In this approach, the actual, trackable task is that *two or more parties consult with each other.* This technique is also applicable in a BPM and Case Management sense.

===== Process execution
Since our initial discussions in Chapter 5 on Work Management, we have progressed through Project and Process Management, and find ourselves returning full circle. Despite the various ways in which work is conceived, funded, and formulated, at the end "it's all just work." We must retain our concern for the "human resources" (that is, people) who find themselves at the mercy of:

* project fractional allocations driving multi-tasking
* processes imposed top down with no demand analysis or evaluation of benefits.
* and the myriads of demands that, although critical, do not seem to fit into either of the first two categories.

The Lean movement manages through minimizing waste and over-processing. This means both taking out un-necessary steps from processes, *AND eliminating un-necessary processes completely when required*. And correspondingly, the processes that remain should have high levels of visibility. They should be taken with the utmost seriousness, and their status should be central to most people's awareness. (This is the purpose of xref:andon[Andon].)

====== From workflow tools to collaboration and digital exhaust
One reason process tends to generate friction and be unpopular is the poor usability of workflow tools. Older tools tend to present myriads of data fields to the user and expect a high degree of training. Each state change in the process is supposed to be logged and tracked by having someone sign in to the tool and update status manually.

By contrast, modern workflow approaches take full advantage of mobile platforms and integration with technology like chat rooms. Mobile development imposes higher standards for user experience (UX) design, which makes trackiing workflow somewhat easier. Integrated software pipelines that integrate application lifecycle and/or project management with source code and build management are increasingly gaining favor. For example:

. A new feature request is logged in the ALM tool
. When assigned to a developer, automatically creates a feature branch in the source control system for developer to work on
. Developer writes tests and associated code, when all passes merges changes back to the central repository
. Build tests automatically are run
. ALM tool is automatically updated accordingly with completion if all tests pass

In an operations context, certain operational commands can be executed directly from the chat window. This is known as "ChatOps:"

****
While in a chat room, team members type commands that the chat bot is configured to execute through custom scripts and plugins. These can range from code deployments to security event responses to team member notifications. The entire team collaborates in real-time as commands are executed. <<Sigler2014>>
****

Properly configured ChatOps provides a rich audit trail of who did what, when, and who else was involved. Fundamental governance objectives of accountability can be considered fulfilled in this way, just as much as having paper or digital forms routed for approval (and with corresponding delays).

In general, the idea is that we can understand digital processes not through painful manual status updates, but rather through their digital exhaust - the data byproducts of people performing the value-add day to day work, at speed and with flow instead of constant delays for approvals and status updates.

===== Process improvement
[quote, Womack and Jones, Lean Thinking]
There tended to be no big picture waiting to be revealed . . . there was only
process kaizen . . . focused on isolated individual steps. . . . We coined the
term “kamikaze kaizen” . . . to describe the likely result: lots of commotion,
many isolated victories . . . [and] loss of the war when no sustainable benefits
reached the customer or the bottom line.

Finally, what is there to say about process improvement from an Agile and Lean perspective? Since these movements are founded on improvement cycles, fast feedback, and self-organization, it might seem redundant to have a section on Agile Process Improvement.

But dysfunction and antipatterns exist here:

* Not basing process improvement in an empirical understanding of the situation
* Process improvement activities that do not involve those affected
* Not treating process activities as demand in and of themselves
* Uncoordinated improvement activities, far from the bottom line

The solutions are to be found largely within Lean theory.

* Understand the facts of the process; do not pretend to understand based on remote reports. "Go and see," in other words.
* Respect people, and understand that best understanding of the situation is held by those closest to it.
* Make time and resources available for improvement activities. For example, assign them a Problem ticket and ensure there are resources specifically tasked with working it, who are given relief from other duties.
* Periodically review improvement activities as part of the overall portfolio. You are placing "bets" on them just as with new features. Do they merit your investment?
